### IST 722 Data Warehousing - Winter 2020
### [SYLLABUS](./IST_722_Syllabus.pdf)

                                   **SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY School of Information Studies**
                                           **IST - 722 Data Warehousing**     

**Description:** Introduction	to	concepts	of	business	intelligence	(BI)	and	the	practice/techniques	in	building	a	BI	solution.	Focuses	are	on	how	to	use	data	warehouses	as	a	BI	solution	to	make	better	organizational	decisions.  
 
**Additional Course Description:** This	course	provides	concepts,	principles,	and	tools	for	designing,	implementing,	and	using	Data	Warehouses.	More	specifically,	we	introduce	database	constructs	such	as	Operational	Data	Store	(ODS),	Data	Warehouse,	and	Data	Mart,	as	well	as	their	components.	We	study	the	differences	between	Ralf	Kimball’s	and	Bill	Inmon's	approaches,	roles	and	responsibilities	in	the	design	and	implementation	of	a	Data	Warehouse,	project	management	guidelines	and	techniques,	requirements	gathering,	dimensional	modeling,	Extract	Transform	and	Load	(ETL)	architecture,	specification	and	data	loading,	master	and	reference	data	management,	integration	approaches	(ETL,	EII,	EAI),	analytical	reporting	concepts,	data	governance	and	recent	trends	in	the	data	warehouse	domain.		
	
The	course	will	leverage	a	portfolio	of	SQL	Server	tools	that	include	SQL	Server	DBMS,	SQL	Server	Integration	Services	(SSIS),	SQL	Server	Reporting	Services	(SSRS)	and	SQL	Server	Analysis	Service	(SSAS)	to	provide	hands-on	experience	in	implementing	a	reporting	solution	through	assignments,	lab	exercises	and	projects.	 

**Learning Objectives:** During the course, we will emphasize:  
1.	Technical	Knowledge	You	will	gain	technical	knowledge	and	comprehension	about	data	warehouses.	You	will	develop	the	ability	to	apply	these	technologies	to	solve	information	problems	at	the	individual	and	organizational	levels.	After	completing	this	course,	you	will	be	able	to:<br>
	• Describe	various	database	constructs	-	ODS,	Data	Warehouse,	Data	Mart<br>
	• Describe	the	components	of	a	data	warehouse<br>
	• Differentiate	between	Ralf	Kimball’s	and	Bill	Inmon's	approaches<br>
	• Describe	various	integration	approaches	-	ETL,	EII,	EAI<br>
	• Describe	a	Master	Data	Management	(MDM)	solution<br>
	• Create	database	objects	using	popular	database	management	system	products<br>
	• Design	and	implement	data	warehouse	and	business	intelligence	components<br>
<br>
2.	Management	of	Solution	Development	You	will	gain	knowledge	and	comprehension	of	the	disciplines	used	in	the	development	of	data	warehouse	solutions.	You	will	develop	the	ability	to	apply	these	disciplines	in	developing	solutions	for	certain	organizational	and	business	problems.	After	completing	this	course,	you	will	be	able	to:<br>
	• Define	the	roles	and	responsibilities	in	the	design	and	development	of	data	warehouses<br>
	• Differentiate	various	requirements	gathering	and	dimensional	modeling	techniques<br>
	• Define	project	management	guidelines<br>
<br>
3.	Management	of	Information	Technology	You	will	be	able	to	integrate	technical	and	solution	development	concepts	with	the	principles	of	data	governance,	strategic	alignment	and	information	analysis.	You	will	be	able	to	apply	these	concepts	in	the	analysis	of	complex	management	case	studies	and	problems.	After	completing	this	course,	you	will	be	able	to:<br>	
	• Describe	the	data	governance	concepts<br>
	• List	some	of	the	recent	trends	in	Data	Warehouse<br>
